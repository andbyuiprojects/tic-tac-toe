# Overview
I chose to create this program in Rust to help me to work with object oriented programming more, and to stretch myself with a more verbose language. I also wanted something that I could make a little different then the other tic-tac-toes and add a little bit of color by using a library. I wrote tic-tac-toe to be able to work with multiple functions, a game loop, handle user input and wor with loops.

# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE for Rust. I think VS Code is very intuitive with its language writing, and it is very streamlined. I also used the termcolor library, which gave me the ability to add color to X adn O in any way I desired. Making it stand out a bit from other tic-tac-toe games one may see in Rust.

# Future Work
- Better user interface
- More clear and defined messages displayed to the user
- A GUI for the Game (such as a pop out window)
